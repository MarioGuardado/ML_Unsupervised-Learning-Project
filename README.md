# ML_Unsupervised-Learning-Project

# Overview
This project involves an analysis of a wholesale customer dataset using unsupervised learning techniques such as KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA). The objective is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and understand the underlying patterns in the data.

# Contents
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This section includes exploratory analysis of the dataset, visualizations, and data preprocessing steps.
- KMeans Clustering: An exploration of customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm.
- Hierarchical Clustering: Analysis of customer segments using hierarchical clustering.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Application of PCA to reduce dimensions and identify key features driving customer segmentation.
- Results and Findings: Summarization of key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

# Technologies Used
- Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and handling datasets.
- NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations and handling arrays.
- Counter (from collections): Used to count occurrences in various contexts.
- Scikit-learn modules:
    - KMeans: For KMeans clustering analysis.
    - AgglomerativeClustering: Used for hierarchical clustering.
    - PCA: For dimensionality reduction and analysis.
    - MinMaxScaler: Essential for feature scaling.
    - silhouette_score and mean_squared_error for model evaluation metrics.
- SciPy modules: `dendrogram` and `linkage` for dendrogram plotting in hierarchical clustering.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization purposes.
- Warnings: Imported to manage and handle warning messages during code execution.


# Usage
- The notebooks or scripts provided here can be executed in sequence to reproduce the analysis.
- Modify parameters or explore different techniques to further investigate the dataset.
- Use the visualizations and findings to derive insights and make business decisions.
